The articl discuss the process of polit and econom transit in Brazil sinc the close of the Constitut Congress. Address the question from an institutionalist perspective, it is argu that these two dimens of the transit are not the onli one which should be consid in conjunction; a seri of other factor must be taken into account as well. First is the question of the sequenti chain within the transit process: polici enact at a given moment depend upon circumst generat earlier, both in content and in form, creat a relat of path-dependence. Second, this constraint hold greater sway dure a transit period, given the fluid condit under which polit are play out: the polit climat and institut chang over time. Third, the actor go through a process of institut learning, which mean the same institut structur are not oper in the same fashion at differ moments. It is necessari to devis a dynam model for analyz Brazil polit system dure this period. More valuabl than ani static model would be an analysi of the process which take into account the intermix of differ polit agenda (simultan and sequentially), institut fluidity, and environment transformations.
