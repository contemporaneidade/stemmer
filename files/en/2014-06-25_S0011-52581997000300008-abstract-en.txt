A promin question in recent compar work is when will the person vote matter? Typically, scholar approach this question at a cross-nat as oppos to a cross-parti level: that is, they highlight featur of nation elector system that creat incent for individu politician to pursu a person (or a party) vote, rather than highlight featur of parti that might predispos candid in those parti to pursu person (or party) votes. Implicitly, the electoral-system comparison hold constant parti features. In this paper, in contrast, I focus on the characterist of parties, as oppos to the characterist of elector systems, as determin of person vote seeking. I argu that adopt of an individualist or collect strategi depend larg on a party access to and control over fund and patronage: generally, parti with good access to money and pork should adopt individualist strategies, while parti with poor access to money and pork should adopt more collect strategies. In this paper, I explor the Brazilian case to test this claim. I test my claim at the nation and district level, use multipl regress analysis. Furthermore, I explain how one party, the Workers Parti (PT), has overcom the incent of the elector system over the long run
